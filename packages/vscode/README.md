# Bonzai extension

This VS Code extension provides syntax highlighting for the Bonzai programming language. Bonzai is a programming language based on actor models. It compiles down to a custom bytecode. It is still in development, but you can find more information about it [here](https://github.com/thomasvergne/bonzai).

## Features

As for now, this extension only provides syntax highlighting for Bonzai files. More features may be added in the future, such as code snippets and language server support.
